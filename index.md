# Uptown Stories

![Little Red Lighthouse](/images/lighthouse.jpg){:.pull-right}

At Uptown Stories, we believe that writing is an essential tool for self-expression, critical thinking, and academic success.

Based in upper Manhattan, we offer small-group writing workshops for children ages eight to fifteen, led by master teachers and professional authors. To ensure our workshops are accessible to all children, tuition is pay-what-you-can.
