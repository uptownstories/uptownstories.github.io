Hey, everyone! This week we learned about using figurative language like:

* similes (comparing things using "like" or "as" e.g. "He's as fast as a cheetah.")
* metaphors (intentionally describing things as something else e.g. "She's a fox!")
* personifications (giving inanimate, non-human things human-like qualities e.g. "The sky grew dark and angry.")
* hyperbole (exaggerating for effect e.g. "He practiced his jump shot a million times before the game.")

Such uses of language make your writing more unique and interesting. **So, for homework this week, you will include at least TWO uses of each of the four types of figurative language listed above in your drafts.**

We also discussed the importance of having not only positive emotions but also negative ones in your essays-in-progress. Like the short film we watched, we want the people who read our personal essays to experience the same highs and lows that we experienced. **So, for homework, also make sure that your personal narrative has at least one high and one low; in other words, your personal narrative should have a mix of negative and positive emotions.**

Now, we want to preview our personal narratives so far. So, you will type up all the writing you have done so far in a logical order and PRINT it for our next workshop.
